# Horiseon-Remaster

## Overview

Greetings. Welcome to the first coding assignment involving HTML and CSS. This is an easy assignment, since the main focus of the project is just to refactor the code so that is makes logical sense for those who are curious about the properties of the webpage. This README will discuss the definintion of refactoring and the only changes made to the parent code provided by the company Horiseons.

So.....first up is defining what refactoring is. This will allow developers to address the task at hand and understand the problem being assigned to us. 

## Refactoring

Refactoring is a disciplined technique where the developer(s) restructures an existing body of code, altering its internal structure without changing its external behavior.

Sounds complicated to the average person right?

Basically, all we are doing to the code is making it easier to read and understand while not affecting how the code functions. This leads us into our user story.

## User Story

As a marekting agency, I want a codebase that follows accessibility standards so that our own site is optimized for search engines.

Ok...so that can seem like a lot to digest at first glance. To put in more technical terms, the code for our website needs to be written in a way for others to view the code and have an understanding of its puropose. Now, this includes making sure the sturcture of the code follows the correct format and that comments are added for each section that describe what EXACTLY this block of text is contributing to the overall structure of the site.

## Acceptance Criteria

This is basically our checcklist. This can help with focusing on each aspect of the problem to achieve the overarching goal.

So here is our accpetance criteria pertaining for our user story:

```
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I fing semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the icon and image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title

```

## Description of code

This will not take up to much space, as the descriptions for the individual attributes will be within the code itself. We have three file; 

Our HTML file [index.html] that will form the backbone of our website

The CSS [style.css] and image [images] that will help to design our website for our specific needs. This will be located in the assets folder [assets]

The refactored code provied doesn't alter any of the websites attributes. The only changes that have been made are the semantc structure of the HTML and CSS elements have been formatted into their proper orientation and the beforementioned comments. 

Here is a preview of the site:
